Description: The Fourier Transform Textural Ordination method 
  uses a principal component analysis on radially averaged
  two dimensional Fourier spectra to characterize image texture. The method
  within the context of ecology was first described by Couteron et al. (2005)
  <doi:10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01097.x> and expanded upon by
  Solorzano et al. (2018) <doi:10.1117/1.JRS.12.036006>
  using a moving window approach.
